/* Change detection: when the region shows a new screen, and when that
 * screen has settled. Kept free of psp2kern so the host tests run it.
 *
 * A frame's signature is a hash of each cell of a grid over the region
 * (cells about as wide as tall: 16x8 on a full screen, 32x4 on a text box),
 * so any change in a cell's sampled pixels is seen, and any cell that
 * differs from the screen's first frame makes a new screen, except:
 *
 * A cell that keeps cycling through a few states (mostly changes back to a
 * recent state: a score of SCENE_ANIM_REVISITS) for SCENE_ANIM_SPAN_US, no
 * pause longer than SCENE_ANIM_GAP_US and no player input, is animated: a
 * blinking or bobbing "next" icon, an AUTO mark, a sparkle. A change within
 * SCENE_INPUT_US of input (a button, a stick, a touch the game read) is the
 * player's doing: a menu scrolled up and down, a choice toggled, a line
 * advanced. It never counts as animation, however few cells it touches.
 * Input is a press or release, a stick or a touch the game read (a held
 * button counts only for its first 1.5 s: see kernel/input.c). An input
 * edge (a press, a release, a touch) also ends every mask, which is a
 * change: a short menu masked while a held button scrolled it is seen
 * again at the release or the next tap; the icons are masked again once
 * they cycle. That costs a press that changes nothing, on a screen with
 * an icon, up to two changes (the mask ending, then the icon's own change
 * within SCENE_INPUT_US). Input is what the game gets: not the overlay's
 * trigger combos, nothing while the overlay is open. Without input
 * (an auto-advancing game, UI that reacts later than SCENE_INPUT_US, input
 * through unhooked touch calls), a menu cycled for SCENE_ANIM_SPAN_US is
 * masked like an icon, until SCENE_ANIM_GAP_US after it stops.
 * At most SCENE_ANIM_MAX cells are masked: an animated background masks
 * none. While any cell is masked and SCENE_ANIM_WARM_US after, any cell is
 * masked once its score reaches SCENE_WARM_REVISITS, without waiting for
 * SCENE_ANIM_SPAN_US (the icon of the next line, wherever that line ends;
 * a short line fading out to an empty box can be taken for one meanwhile).
 * A cell next to an animated one that goes back to a recent state without
 * input is masked with it, for as long as that one is: the edge of the
 * icon, reached by its largest frames only (at most SCENE_ANIM_MAX more).
 *
 * A mask ends SCENE_ANIM_GAP_US after the cell stops (the icon's, for an
 * edge), at an input edge, or once an icon cell holds a state it had not
 * shown before for SCENE_STABLE_US (new content; while it keeps changing,
 * such states are taken as frames of the animation: one read while the
 * game draws it, or sampled for the first time). That is a change:
 * whatever the mask hid is not taken as the screen after that. New
 * content in an edge cell, or in an icon cell that keeps changing, is
 * seen only then.
 *
 * Settling waits while an icon cycles before it is masked: a screen with a
 * blinking icon settles when the icon first appears (a new state) and
 * again about SCENE_ANIM_SPAN_US later, once it is masked; with a recent
 * mask, once. A single icon-sized revert (A, B, A) without input also
 * waits up to SCENE_ANIM_GAP_US; a line replaced by a shorter one does
 * not.
 *
 * Quiet: before that, once every change for SCENE_QUIET_US has stayed in
 * one spot of SCENE_SPOT x SCENE_SPOT cells, and the spot went back to a
 * recent state (an icon not masked yet; text being typed moves on, and
 * only to new states), the screen is quiet: worth capturing. A
 * capture taken since the spot started differs from the screen in the
 * spot only, so it shows the screen with the spot left aside
 * (scene_match_since), until something changes outside the spot, a mask
 * ends or an input edge. A spot that changes to new content in place (a
 * one-character counter) is taken for the icon meanwhile. */
