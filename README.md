# Vita JP Overlay

Overlay for japanese learners. Text recognition uses Google Lens, and the definitions come from
[jiten.moe](https://jiten.moe) or [jpdb.io](https://jpdb.io).

The idea comes from [meikidroid](https://github.com/rtr46/meikidroid)

![The overlay over a visual novel: the recognized text with the selected word highlighted, and its jiten.moe entry below](docs/screenshot.jpg)

## Requirements

- A PS Vita on firmware 3.60 to 3.74 with HENkaku Ensō or h-encore.
- Wi-Fi.
- An API key from jiten.moe or jpdb.io.

## Installing

### From the release zip

1. Download `VitaJPOverlay-<version>.zip` from the [Releases](../../releases) page.
2. Copy the zip's `ur0` folder to the root of `ur0:` on the Vita. VitaShell's FTP server or
  USB mode both work. You should end up with:
  - `ur0:tai/VitaJPOverlay_Kernel.skprx`
  - `ur0:tai/VitaJPOverlay_Shell.suprx`
  - `ur0:data/VitaJPOverlay/vitajpoverlay.rco`
3. Open `ur0:tai/config.txt` (or `ux0:tai/config.txt`, if that is the one your taiHEN uses) and
  add two lines:
  - `ur0:tai/VitaJPOverlay_Kernel.skprx` on a new line under `*KERNEL`
  - `ur0:tai/VitaJPOverlay_Shell.suprx` on a new line under `*main`
4. Copy the zip's `config.ini` to `ux0:data/VitaJPOverlay/config.ini` and set your API key: `jiten_api_key`, or
  `dictionary = jpdb` and `jpdb_api_key`. Change any other settings you like. The file is read
   each time the overlay opens, so later changes need no reboot.
5. Reboot.

To update, copy the new files over the old ones and power-cycle the Vita. Your `config.ini`
stays as it is.

### From a computer, over FTP

If you have the source and a built copy of the plugins, `tools/install_ftp.sh` does the
steps above in one go. It needs bash, curl and python3 (macOS or Linux). Start VitaShell's FTP
server (press Select in VitaShell) and run:

```bash
tools/install_ftp.sh --set dictionary=jiten --set jiten_api_key=your-key <vita-ip>
```

It backs up and patches the taiHEN config files, uploads the plugins and writes `config.ini`.
Running it again later keeps your settings. `--uninstall` removes the plugin lines and
`--status` prints the plugin logs.

## Using it

### Choose which games use the overlay

Install `JPOverlaySettings.vpk` from the release zip using VitaShell, then open
the **JP Overlay Settings** bubble. It shows installed games from `ux0:app`,
`ur0:app`, and an inserted cartridge, with game names, icons and ON/OFF switches.
Turn **Uncharted** OFF to leave L+R available for aiming and firing.

Changes save automatically. Close the settings app and restart or resume the
game. Disabled games receive their normal buttons and touch input: neither OCR,
subtitles nor overlay shortcuts activate in them. Choices survive Vita restarts.

| Settings app input | Action |
| --- | --- |
| D-pad / L or R | Select a game / move a page |
| × or tap a game | Toggle that game ON/OFF |
| △ or tap the default row | Switch between all games by default and selected games only |
| □ | Filter all, enabled or disabled games |
| Start | Refresh installed games (including an inserted cartridge) |
| ○ | Exit |

Existing installations enable all games until you change a setting. Per-game
choices override the default; switching the default keeps those choices.
Adrenaline's PSP games share the `NPXS10028` setting. The settings app and
system utilities never reserve overlay shortcuts.
If a game's title ID cannot be identified, it stays disabled once per-game
choices exist, so an unknown title cannot bypass your exclusions.

The policy lives in `ux0:data/VitaJPOverlay/games.ini`, separately from API keys
and OCR regions. For example (use your game's actual title ID):

```ini
default = enabled
PCSA00029 = disabled
```

Saves keep a `games.ini.bak` recovery copy. If both copies are unreadable,
the overlay stays disabled and the app reports the error without replacing
your choices. Repair the file in VitaShell or restore your backup.

### In a game

In a game:

| ×                | Add the word to Anki (when set up, see [Anki](#anki)). A green √ marks words already in your deck.                                           |
| □                | Choose the area to read in this game. Drag a box on the touchscreen, then press × to keep it or ○ to cancel. Holding □ sets the full screen. |
| ○, or the toggle | Close the overlay.                                                                                                                           |

Works with PSP games in Adrenaline. They all share one OCR region, because every PSP game runs inside the same emulator app.




## Settings

All settings live in `ux0:data/VitaJPOverlay/config.ini`. The area to read (□ in the overlay) is saved per game in
`ux0:data/VitaJPOverlay/region.ini`.

## Anki

× adds selected word to Anki, along with the reading, furigana, definitions, the sentence, a screenshot of the game, the frequency rank and (optionally) the word's audio. Words already in your deck show a green √.

1. In Anki, install [AnkiConnect](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2055492159).
2. Tools → Add-ons → AnkiConnect → Config: set `"webBindAddress": "0.0.0.0"`, then restart Anki.
3. In `config.ini`, set `anki_host = auto` (the Vita searches your network once and remembers the computer) or your computer's IP. Set `anki_deck` to your deck; it's created if missing.
4. The default note type is [Lapis](https://github.com/donkuri/lapis). For another note type, set `anki_note_type` and the `anki_field_*` keys to its field names; leave a key empty to skip that data. Duplicates are checked on the note type's first field, so map the word to that field.
5. Optional, word audio: set `anki_audio_url` to a Yomitan custom audio source URL, the same one you'd paste into Yomitan, with `{term}` and `{reading}` in it. To host your own, see [yomitan-ultimate-audio](https://github.com/friedrich-de/yomitan-ultimate-audio?tab=readme-ov-file). The Vita looks up the word there and Anki downloads the audio.

| `anki_field_word`       | `Expression`         | Field for the word.                                                                  |
| `anki_field_reading`    | `ExpressionReading`  | Field for the reading in kana.                                                       |
| `anki_field_furigana`   | `ExpressionFurigana` | Field for the word with its reading, `言葉[ことば]`.                                      |
| `anki_field_definition` | `MainDefinition`     | Field for the definitions, as a numbered list.                                       |
| `anki_field_sentence`   | `Sentence`           | Field for the recognized text, with the word in bold.                                |
| `anki_field_picture`    | `Picture`            | Field for the screenshot of the game.                                                |
| `anki_field_frequency`  | `FreqSort`           | Field for the frequency rank.                                                        |
| `anki_field_audio`      | `ExpressionAudio`    | Field for the word's audio.                                                          |
| `anki_audio_url`        | empty                | Yomitan custom audio source URL with `{term}` and `{reading}`: empty = no audio.     |




## Privacy

- The chosen area of the screen is sent to Google Lens for text recognition. In `auto` mode,
and while subtitles are on, that happens every time the area changes while a game is running.
- The recognized text is sent to jiten.moe (`api.jiten.moe`) or jpdb.io, along with your API
key.
- With Anki set up, the cards (including the screenshot) go to Anki on your computer over your
local network. `anki_host = auto` looks for it on port 8765 of the other devices on your
network.
- With `anki_audio_url` set, each word you add is sent to that audio source, and Anki
downloads the audio from the link it returns.
- Nothing else leaves the console. Logs go only where `log_host` and `log_file` send them.



## Troubleshooting

The plugins write two logs to `ux0:data/VitaJPOverlay/`: `kernel.txt` from the kernel plugin
and `status.txt` from the SceShell plugin. Both start over at each boot (the previous boot's
copies are kept as `*.prev.txt`) and stop at 64 KB. `tools/install_ftp.sh --status <vita-ip>`
prints all of them.

Some games turn Wi-Fi off to save power. For those, install
[NoPowerLimits](https://github.com/Electry/NoPowerLimitsVita) alongside this plugin
(`tools/install_ftp.sh --add-kernel-plugin NoPowerLimits.skprx <vita-ip>` does it for you).

## Building

Set up the toolchain once (vitasdk, taiHEN, the ScePaf headers and stubs, and psp2cxml-tool):

```bash
tools/setup_toolchain.sh
```

Build and run the tests on your computer:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build/host -G Ninja && cmake --build build/host && ./build/host/vjo-tests
```

Build the plugins and the release zip (`build/vita/VitaJPOverlay-<version>.zip`):

```bash
cmake -S vita -B build/vita && cmake --build build/vita --target release
```

`vjo-cli` runs the same pipeline on a screenshot:

```bash
VJO_JITEN_KEY=your-key ./build/host/vjo-cli --dict jiten screenshot.jpg --nav
```
